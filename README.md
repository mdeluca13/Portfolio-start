# Portfolio

## Description

This is a page for potential employers to view the skills that I have to offer when they are looking to fill a position. This page outlines who I am, what work I have developed so far and how to contact me.

I developed this page from scratch so it was very effective in teaching me trial and error, taking breaks to refresh my body and mind, and using the resources available to me to add features to the page or problem solve an error.
